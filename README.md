# Final-Project
My project is the game of hangman. One person inputs a word to guess, and the other person guesses letters in the terminal until their guess the word or lose. I used a method to clear the terminal that I found here (https://stackoverflow.com/a/32295974).
To run the project, downloada the HangMan.java and Display.java files and put them in a new java project. Then, run the Hangman.java file.
